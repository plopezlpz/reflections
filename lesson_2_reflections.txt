What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates the metadata with the necessary git files so that  I can start committing.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area and the repository seem quite related, the working copy might contain extra files that we don't want to version control.
